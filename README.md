Dice Battle is a website which takes 2 players who play against each other by rolling dice to decide their fate. Each player has health and have the ability to either attack or heal each turn equivalent to the amount of what they roll on their dice. Our website makes this game turn based game easy to play whilst being fun.

## Overview
The Dice Battle game allows 2 players to join a server/room through the room each player will play against each other (turn based). Each player starts with a base amount of health. Then each player rolls their dice, and through the UI they have the ability to either Attack or Heal in that turn. The value of what each player attacks or heals will depend on the value of their dice roll. If a player attacks the value of the dice roll will remove that from the opposing players health, whilst healing adds to their own health (value decided by their dice roll). The game will continue until a player ends with 0 Health crowning a victor.
